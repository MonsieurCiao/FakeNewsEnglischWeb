        <h2 class="more-header">Why fake news?</h2>
        <p class="part-two-text">
            Fake news are something that is appealing to everyone because they either give the reader something to blame for anything really or give the reader excitement because of something new. They are dangerous and sometimes harmful, for we fall easily for them and their omnipresence. So it is important to inform how to avoid fake news and distinguish them from reality.
            This is the reason why fake news was picked as a topic and what better way to learn about them than to create them.

        <h2 class="more-header">How to avoid falling for fake news</h2>
        <p class="part-five-text-one">
            Since fake news are so dangerous it is essential that everyone knows how to spot them. Here are some different things you can do:
        </p>
        <div class="grid-container">
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Verify Sources</h3>
                <p>Before believing or sharing any news, scrutinize the source. Reliable news outlets typically adhere to journalistic standards, providing well-researched and corroborated information. Check if other credible sources are reporting the same story.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Evaluate the Headline</h3>
                <p>Headlines are crafted to grab attention, but they may not always reflect the full context of the story. Read beyond the headline to grasp the complete picture. Misleading headlines can twist the truth, so delve deeper into the content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Check for Bias</h3>
                <p>Recognize the potential bias of the source. Some outlets have specific agendas or lean towards particular ideologies. Understanding their perspective helps in interpreting the information more objectively.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Examine the Content</h3>
                Assess the content for credibility. Look for supporting evidence, quotes from reputable sources, and cross-references to verify claims. Be cautious of articles lacking sources or containing inflammatory language without substantiation.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="part-five-text-two">
            In a digital landscape inundated with information, honing your critical thinking skills and exercising caution can serve as a shield against falling for fake news. By adopting these practices, you empower yourself to navigate the information age more confidently and responsibly.
